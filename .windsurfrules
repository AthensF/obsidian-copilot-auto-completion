I am in the middle of building a Chrome Extension app that provide sentence completion for Monaco editor in Google Colab, for veterinary scribes

I am stuck in that project because it is properly (FITB) filling in the blank, like I want it to.  I need to learn from an existing project that has the desired FITB capabilities.

This is where this project comes in.  This is an example project that FITB, that caters to many use cases (eg. code completion), many that is irrelevant to what I want to learn.  The main use case I want to learn from is on sentence completion.  Also, this is an Obsidian extension, so some of it may not be relevant, given that we are building a chrome extension.

This is a learning exercise, so donâ€™t worry about suggesting ways that I could improve the code.
